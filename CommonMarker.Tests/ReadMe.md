CommonMarker.Tests is both a unit test battery (found in Spec.cs) as well as an executable to create the Spec class.
# Usage
Run CommonMarker.Tests. It will create a "Spec.cs" file with a unit test for each example found in the CommonMark spec (found at http://jgm.github.io/stmd/spec.html). You can then replace the Spec.cs file found in this library with the newly obtained Spec.cs. Run all tests.
